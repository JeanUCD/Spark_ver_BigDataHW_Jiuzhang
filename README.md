## Project: Rewriting Jiuzhang Big Data course projects in Spark

The original homework and reference answers are [here](https://github.com/MinBigData). The course introduces the concept and use of Hadoop MapReduce framework, and implemented a few widely-used algorithms in Java.

This project aims to rewrite those algorithms in PySpark, which is much more flexible and much simpler to write and read.

##### Environment

The Jupyter notebooks here are developed and tested on the [Docker container with Jupyter and PySpark installed](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/pyspark-notebook), provided by Jupyter. Those programs should also run on other Spark-installed machines.
